# Credit System Fix Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Credit Retrieval API Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend was calling wrong API endpoint for user data
**Solution**: Updated `useAuth.js` to use `/api/v1/user` instead of `/cms/current-user`
**Impact**: Now pulls credit data from `shop.current_token_qty` properly

### 2. ✅ Frontend Event System 
**Problem**: Header not updating after payments
**Solution**: Added comprehensive event listeners in Header.vue and Dashboard.vue
**Events**: `credits-updated` and `payment-success`

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Real-time Data
**Problem**: Dashboard showing mock data instead of real API data
**Solution**: Updated Dashboard.vue to load real data from API endpoints
**Features**: 
- Real credit balance from user data
- Real total spent from invoice data  
- Real plan information
- Real invoice history
- Manual refresh button for testing

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Debugging
**Problem**: Hard to debug credit update issues
**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the system
**Debugging**: Console messages show credit calculations and event flow

## Database Verification:
✅ **Test Results**: User "Tiep Dang" has 12,900 credits in database
✅ **API Logic**: AuthController correctly calculates credit from shop.current_token_qty
✅ **Expected Response**: API should return credit: 12900

## Testing Instructions:

### Frontend Testing:
1. **Login to Dashboard**: Use credentials for user with credits
2. **Open Browser Console**: Check for debug messages
3. **Look for Messages**:
   - `useAuth: User set with updated credit: {credit: 12900}`
   - `Header getCredit computed - credit value: 12900`
   - `Dashboard getCredit computed - credit value: 12900`

### Manual API Testing:
```javascript
// Run in browser console after login:
fetch('/api/v1/user', {credentials: 'same-origin'})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('API Response:', data);
    console.log('Credit Value:', data.data?.user?.credit);
  });
```

### Event Testing:
```javascript
// Test event system in console:
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('credits-updated', {
  detail: { source: 'test', amount: 1000 }
}));
```

### Payment Flow Testing:
1. **Make a test payment**
2. **Check browser console** for:
   - `Payment success event received`
   - `Credits updated event received`
   - API calls to `/api/v1/user`
3. **Verify credit display updates** in header and dashboard

## Key Files Modified:

### Backend:
- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Api/AuthController.php` - Enhanced user() method with shop credits
- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Api/InvoiceController.php` - Fixed Total Paid calculation
- ✅ `routes/api.php` - API routes properly configured

### Frontend:
- ✅ `resources/js/composables/useAuth.js` - Fixed API endpoint and added fallback
- ✅ `resources/js/components/Header.vue` - Added event listeners and debugging
- ✅ `resources/js/views/Dashboard.vue` - Real-time data loading and manual refresh
- ✅ `resources/js/views/Plan.vue` - Enhanced with confirmation dialogs and events

## Expected Behavior After Fix:

1. **Credit Display**: Should show 12,900 credits for test user
2. **Real-time Updates**: Credit should update immediately after payment
3. **Dashboard Data**: Should show real invoice totals and plan information  
4. **Event System**: Console should show event flow during payments
5. **Manual Refresh**: "Refresh Data" button should update all information

## Troubleshooting:

If credits still show 0:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify `/api/v1/user` endpoint accessibility
3. Check if `admin.auth` middleware is working
4. Verify user has `shop_id` and shop has `current_token_qty`
5. Test manual refresh button functionality

## Next Steps:
1. Test the credit display with a real user session
2. Verify payment flow updates credits correctly  
3. Test plan switching with confirmation dialogs
4. Verify Total Paid calculation accuracy in invoices
